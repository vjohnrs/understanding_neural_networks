Neural Network 

step-1: preparing raw data to train the model

step-1: conver raw data into tensors, an internal representation the helps with matrix multiplications.
Neural network fundamentally uses matrix operations. 


step-2: setting up the architecture for how a neural network learns.

step-3: training the network

step-4 predicting with the network# understanding_neural_networks
